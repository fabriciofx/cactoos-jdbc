## Introduction

**Cactoos JDBC** is a collection of object-oriented Java wrapper classes to
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity).

**Motivation**.
We are not happy with
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity)
because it is procedural and not object-oriented. It does its job, but mostly
through strongly coupled classes and static methods. Cactoos JDBC is suggesting
to do almost exactly the same, but through (more OO) objects.

Besides, [ORM is a
anti-pattern](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)
and should avoid with all cost. But we can use an library to help us to make
our data persistence. Thus, Cactoos JDBC will help us to do it too.

**Principles**.
These are the [design principles](http://www.elegantobjects.org#principles)
behind Cactoos JDBC.


## Features

- Select, Insert, Update and Delete data from a
[RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system)
- Named parameters statement
- Retrieve the data as XML
- Easy logging
- SQL Script execution
- Batch
- Transactions
- Pagination


## Feature to be implemented

- ~~Tests on PostgreSQL and MySQL RDBMS~~ (done)
- Retrieve the data as JSON
- Caching
- Call Store Procedures


## How to use

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.fabriciofx</groupId>
  <artifactId>cactoos-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Java version required: 1.8+.


### Usage

Let's show how use the API. For all above examples, let's start creating a
`Session` object:
```java
final Session session = new NoAuth(
    new H2Source("testdb")
);
```


### Update

Now, let's create a table using a `Update` command:
```java
new Update(
    session,
    new QueryOf(
        new Joined(
            " ",
            "CREATE TABLE employee (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,"
            "name VARCHAR(50), salary DOUBLE)"
        )
    )
).result()
```


### Insert

Let's insert a new employee and return the id of inserted employee.
```java
final int id = new ResultAsValue<Integer>(
    new InsertWithKey(
        session,
        new QueryWithKey(
            () -> "INSERT INTO employee (name, salary) VALUES (:name, :salary)",
            "id",
            new TextOf("name", "Jeff Bridge"),
            new DoubleOf("salary", 12345.00)
        )
    )
).value();
```


### Select

Let's retrieve the name of a employee:
```java
final String name = new ResultAsValue<String>(
    new Select(
        session,
        new QueryOf(
            "SELECT name FROM employee WHERE id = :id",
            new IntOf("id", 123)
        )
    )
).value();
```

Let's retrieve all employee salaries:
```java
final List<Double> salaries = new ResultAsValues<Double>(
    new Select(
        session,
        new QueryOf("SELECT salary FROM employee")
    )
).value();
```


### Transaction

To enable a transaction you will need to do two things:
1. Decorates a `Session` using a `Transacted` object, like here:
```java
final Session transacted = new Transacted(session);
```
2. Use a `Transaction` object to perform all transacted operations,
like here:
```java
new Transaction(
  transacted,
  () -> {
    final Contact contact = new ContactsSql(transacted)
        .contact("Albert Einstein");
    contact.phones().phone("912232325", "TIM");
    contact.phones().phone("982231234", "Oi");
    return contact;
  }
).result();
```

To a complete example, please take a look [here](https://github.com/fabriciofx/cactoos-jdbc/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/fabriciofx/cactoos/jdbc/statement/TransactionTest.java).


### Pagination

To enable pagination, you need define a method which should return `Pages<>` of
ah object, like this:

```java
public interface Phonebook {
    ...
    Pages<Contact> contacts(int max) throws Exception;
}
```

And in this method, we need create a `SqlPages<>` object, that must contains
three objects:
1) A `QueryOf` that must return the amount of registers;
2) A `QueryOf` that must return all registers (don't worry: pagination will not
   retrieve all registers. They will be paginated);
3) An `Adapter` that will transform a `ResulSet` in an object.

We can see an example bellow:

```java
public final class SqlPhonebook implements Phonebook {
    ...
    @Override
    public Pages<Contact> contacts(final int max) throws Exception {
        return new SqlPages<>(
            this.session,
            new QueryOf("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contact"),
            new QueryOf("SELECT * FROM contact"),
            new ResulSetAsContact(this.session),
            max
        );
    }
}
```

To see more details, please take a look [here](https://github.com/fabriciofx/cactoos-jdbc/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/fabriciofx/cactoos/jdbc/phonebook).


### Logging

To enable logging just decorate a `Session` object:
```java
final Session logged = new Logged(session);
```


## Phonebook application (demo)

A phonebook application has been developed to demonstrate and test the
catoos-jdbc API. To see it, please look [here](https://github.com/fabriciofx/cactoos-jdbc/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/fabriciofx/cactoos/jdbc/phonebook).
